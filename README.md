# KeyOverlay
 A simple key overlay for osu! streaming
# What's different
I added: kps counter, hide hotkey (also transparent background doesnt really work bruh)
 
Edit `config.ini` to set your keymap
IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAM WHEN OSU! IS ON FULLSCREEN, TRY USING GAME CAPTURE INSTEAD OF WINDOW CAPTURE IN OBS!
